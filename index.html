        <h1>Breaking Bad On TV</h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good.
         Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that,
         either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every
         bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 
         '<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Breaking Bad</a>'
          just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.
        </p>
        <h2>Any similarities?</h2>
        <p>The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family
         man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before
         it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'
         (for those who don't get the reference: watch 
         '<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3" target="_blank">Fight Club</a>'
         - you won't regret it).
        </p>
        <h2>10 years on, TV is still in Walter White's shadow</h2>
        <p>
            Ten years ago, Breaking Bad made its TV debut. A comic drama starring the dad from Malcolm in the Middle,
            it answered the question middle-aged men had asked of themselves for generations: what would happen if I quit my boring
            job and became an outlaw? The answer, it appeared, involved drugs, mobile homes and being stranded in the desert in your pants.
            First impressions of Vince Gilliganâ€™s now seminal drama may have been misleading, however. By the end of the pilot episode the
            protagonist, Walter White, had murdered a man. His initial adventures may have had a slapstick air to them, but it soon became
            difficult to laugh.
